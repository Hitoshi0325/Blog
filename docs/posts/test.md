# How I got the Goethe B1 in just 3 months

![viteprss](../public/goethe.png)

To be honest, I started studying German for the first time in April 2024. Then I obtained the Goethe B1 in just 3 months. Here’s how I achieved it:

- Start early for input.
- Review regularly for memorization.
- Use DW (Deutsche Welle) resources.
- Practice writing and speaking.

You can imagine that German is quite challenging for foreigners to master because the grammar is very different. (Pronunciation is similar.) Therefore, we need to pay attention to both grammar and pronunciation. Specifically, I would get up at 5:30 AM and go to a coffee shop every day before starting my job training (2 hours).

I did the same during train rides. At that time, I always used DW for listening practice. DW offers free German radio broadcasting that is very useful.

However, the most important aspect is “Speaking.” In Japan, it is challenging to find people who speak German. I studied online every day (more than 1 hour), and through this experience, my speaking skills improved.

Basically, studying German is free except for books and online speaking lessons (Spanish and English too). It cost me around $400 in 3 months.

Although it was tough, I am confident in my ability to face new challenges now.
